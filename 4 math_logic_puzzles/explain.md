# Factorial 
The factorial of a number is the product of all the numbers from 1 to that number. For example,
factorial of 5 is equal to 1 * 2 * 3 * 4 * 5 = 120.
The factorial of a positive number n is given by:
```
factorial of n (n!) = 1 * 2 * 3 * 4.....n
```

# Plaindrome
A palindrome number is a number that is same after reverse. For example 121, 34543, 343, 131, 48984 are the palindrome numbers.

## Palindrome number algorithm

* Get the number from user
* Hold the number in temporary variable
* Reverse the number
* Compare the temporary number with reversed number
* If both numbers are same, print palindrome number
* Else print not palindrome number
